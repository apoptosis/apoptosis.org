#+title: Home Manager

https://github.com/nix-community/home-manager

A system for managing per-user configuration including /home artifacts.

* Installation

Add the channel
#+begin_src sh
  sudo nix-channel --add https://github.com/nix-community/home-manager/archive/master.tar.gz home-manager
  sudo nix-channel --update
#+end_src

* Activation Packages
Activation packages are executed after the profile has been activated.

These can run shellcode that can affect your /home directory, which is usually
not possible.

First import the dag module:
#+begin_src nix
  with import <home-manager/modules/lib/dag.nix> { inherit lib; };
#+end_src

Then add a new entry:
#+begin_src nix
  home.activation.ssh-personal = dagEntryAfter ["installPackages"] ''
    chmod 400 /Users/dustinlacewell/.ssh/personal
  '';
#+end_src
