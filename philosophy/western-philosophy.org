- Moral judgment cannot be based on rational deliberation, because simpletons and
  infants are also capable of making more judgments.

  our species are the most moral.
- Therefore, our sense of morality is based in part on our biology and in part by our
  social context.
- What makes a moral rule a universal more rule?
  - Primarily, its utility
  - All government and political institutions have their basis in utility to society.
- We have a natural appreciation for virtuous behavior, and are thus naturally moral
  at least in part.
- You cannot deterministically go from an "is" to an "ought"
*** Religion
- Basing religious belief on inference from experience has four flaws
  - It means that religion is probable at best, because all ideas are derived from experience, not reason.
  - In all scientific inquiries, negative evidence counts more than positive evidence. So we would require positive evidence with zero negative evidence in order to justify our belief in god through experience.
- Effects do not prove a cause.
- In the end, Hume is dismissive of both religion in general and in the ability to
  base religious belief on experience.

  - Space and Time
  - Object Persistence
  - Causality
  - Existence
  - Plurality
  - Unity
- Metaphysics goes beyond our experience, and thus outside of pure reason
- Disagreed with Locke and Hume and their empericism - the idea that all ideas and truths come from experience
- Without his 'categories of understanding' none of our experiences would make any
  sense.
*** The Critique of Practical Reason
- Maxim: Act only that that maxim by which you can at the same time will that it
  become a universal law.
- Practical Reason is concerned with how we ought to live.
- A moral law cannot consist primarily of hypothetical imperatives
  - Ex: If you want to stay healthy, you should eat right and exercise.
  - Ex: If you want to become a doctor, than you should study.
- Hypothetical imperatives fail because they only apply to those who want the outcome they describe.
- Categorical Imperatives have no qualification clause
  - Instead of saying "Do not lie if you want to be trusted" (hypothetical), instead it should be "Do not lie".
  - Categorical Imperatives must not depend on circumstance, desire or on the consequences of their actions
- The notion of Free Will is justified by our ability to self-legislate - to create
  rules that we should follow, and then to follow them.

** Qine
[[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Willard_Van_Orman_Quine]]
- Effective critic of logical positivism
- Attacked Empiricism
  - There is no real distinction between synthetic truths and analytic truths.
  - The principle of reductionism - that every high level statement could ultimately be reduced to simpler statements of sense experience - does not work.
  - This is because our ability to reason about sensory experience is constrained by the symbol language we use to reason about it.  These language impose their own boundary conditions to what can be reasoned.
** Habermas
[[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jürgen_Habermas]]
- Stressed the importance of the 'public sphere' of communications and how it enabled democracy.
- These social institutions enabled groups of individuals to discuss and openly debate and ultimately impact their political institutions.

** Rawls
[[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Rawls]]
*** Wrote "A Theory of Justice"
- The task of any theory of social justice is the legitimate the inequalities that emerge in the basic structure of society.
- To assess any system, you must do so from the 'original position'
  - Veil of Ignorance: You must not know your place in the social structure of society, or what your natural talents may be.
  - All participants must be disinterested in the outcome of the debate.
- Each person is to have an equal right to the most extensive basic liberty that is compatible with a similar liberty held by all others.

- He wants to free us from the guilt over the absence of absolute meaning or purpose in life. There can be none, so get over it.
** Rorty
[[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rorty]]
- Absolute truth cannot be found in language - it is merely a statement that we approve of.
- Modern philosophers should give up the pursuit of absolute truth, and instead should seek to eliminate the cruelties of everyday life that these historical social norms have placed upon us.
- His basic critique of western philosophy centers on the refutation of the existence of a "God's eye-view" of the world
- Pragmatism is the ultimate anti-philosophy
  - Rejects the goal of defining truth as the level of correspondence with an objective reality.
  - Truth should be approached pragmatically: Does the statement work for us?
  - Also rejects absolute realism. Our experience of reality will always be influenced by the conceptual framework in which we analyze it. And that framework is constantly changing.
- Argues that many aspects of our language and are beliefs are contingent - not necessarily true or false.
- But it is important for our overall system of beliefs to 'hand together' and to be free of inconsistencies.
** Gouldner
[[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alvin_Ward_Gouldner]]
- Critic of the Marxist attempt to define society in terms of who owns the means of physical production, and the class distinctions that such a model result in.
- The succession of modern ideologies owes its existence to the American and French revolutions, which made it possible to be an intellectual dissident.
- Each ideology seeks to destroy competing ideologies while itself claiming to be disinterested.
- Class struggle in the modern west occur between old money and new intelligentsia (engineers, doctors, lawyers, scientists)
  - The struggle is not, as Marx described it, between those who controlled the means of production and the serfs below them.
** MacIntyre
[[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alasdair_MacIntyre]]
- Rejects the moral relativism that began with the Enlightenment thinkers (Locke, Hume, Kant).
- Admits that an absolute proof of any particular moral theory is beyond reach, but that our social traditions are a valid basis by which to evaluate our moral theories.
- Claims that social tradition is a necessary precondition for rationality. Without those traditions, there can be no rationality.
- The moral relativism of 'modern philosophy' is itself yet another tradition.
- He sees 'modern philosophy' as a tradition that is hostile to the very notion of traditions, and is thus self-contradictory.
*** The 'is-ought' gap
- This is the fundamental problem for all moral philosophy.
- If you believe in a fundamental difference between statements of fact vs. statements of value, it becomes impossible to to move from 'what is' to 'what ought to be'.
- This inability to find a rational justification to any given set of moral rules is a pervasive feature of modern philosophical endeavors.
- Thus modern philosophy leads to moral skepticism.
*** What is a tradition?
- The entire history of its world view over time.
- The community of people who are its bearers.
- The social practices of that community.
- They are like Kuhn's Scientific Paradigms.
- However, it must be possible for one tradition to judge other traditions based on
  rational criteria.
  - Example (Margaret Med): A primitive New Guinean tribe will have a tradition of beliefs, including truths about the world, that directly contradict most modern western traditions.
  - But we should not conclude that their belief system is un-judge-able, or equal to our traditional system of beliefs - there MUST be a basic by which to critique.
  - Nazi-ism, for example, is a tradition. We should be able to rationally argue why it is a bad tradition. Why it is wrong. Relativism would make this judgement impossible.
- The criteria: One tradition is more rational than another if
  - It can explain both the success and failures of the other tradition better than the other tradition itself can explain.
  - If it can understand the other tradition well enough to explain its failures to it in the other tradition's own terms.
** Nozick
[[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nozick]]
*** Limited Governement
- Wrote "Anarchy, State, and Utopia"
- Starts with the basic principle that a lone individual has certain rights that no other person may infringe upon.
- Then asks the question: With that as the basis, is there a form of government that can adhere to that principle? If so, what would it look like?
- The starting point is an individual who has the right to personal property. That is the state of nature.
  - Nozick does not attempt to justify this starting point - where does that initial right derive from and can it be proven. He simply takes it 'as-is'.
  - This is a weakness that others have used to refute much of his arguments.
- He then argues that only a very limited state may exist that would not infringe upon that fundamental right.
  - Involuntary redistribution of the wealth for even a single individual would be illegitimate.
- Nozick argues that a minimalist government is possible that does not infringe upon this basic right, and that it can be achieved without gaining the consent or participation of ALL individuals (which would necessarily entail some amount of coercion).
  - The only role of this minimal government is to enforce protection rights (police and judicial).
*** Redistribution of Wealth
- Taxes mean that others have a claim of ownership in you, and are therefore morally equivalent to forced labor and slavery.
- However, charitable redistribution is fine - only forced redistribution is wrong.
*** How do we assess a just society
- The means: The individual steps that led to the current distribution of wealth were each fair, just and entered into freely by both participants.
- The ends: The resulting distribution of wealth is equal among all participants, regardless of whether coercion was used to move some wealth from one to another.
