Amino Acids are molecules with a standard inner structure, allowing them to be repeatedly linked together into "peptide chains". Each amino acid is differentiated by a molecular side-chain structure unique to each amino acid. What is this standard structure and how do the side-chains fit into the picture?

As a peptide chain, or polypeptide, forms various forces, dependant on the specific amino acids in the peptide, and their ordering, cause the peptide to fold into a specific structure. The folded structure is called a protein. What are these various forces and how do they fold the peptide into a protein?

How does DNA and RNA are linear molecular chains (much like peptides) but composed of just 4 unique molecules called nucleotides. But there are over 60 amino acids which can partake in polypeptides. How is DNA robust enough to encode for so many amino acids? Further, how are polypeptides, which fold into proteins, actually manufactured using genetic information?

A common mis-conceptualization of how biological materials reach their destinations are through osmosis, diffusion and other random brownian motions. However, there is a whole domain of motor proteins which can actually walk along the microtubule cytoskeleton and actin filiments of a cell and drag along specially targetted cargo. How many kinds of motors are there? What are their exact mechanisms of action? What roles in cell function and health do motor proteins serve?
